Project Overview
This project analyzes ecommerce sales data to uncover key insights into customer behavior, product trends, and overall business performance. Using Python, we explore sales trends, identify top products and customers, and perform RFM and churn analysis to improve business strategies.

Dataset
The dataset includes transactional records such as InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.
Additional columns like TotalSales (Quantity * UnitPrice) and Profit were derived for deeper analysis.
Key Analyses Performed
✅ Sales Trends: Monthly revenue patterns analyzed using time series visualization.
✅ Top Products & Customers: Identified best-selling products and high-value customers.
✅ RFM Analysis: Segmented customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value.
✅ Churn Analysis: Detected inactive customers for retention strategies.
✅ Country-wise Sales: Examined global distribution of sales.
✅ Profitability Analysis: Determined the most profitable products and estimated costs.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python 🐍
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Visualization: Line charts, bar charts, and annotated graphs
