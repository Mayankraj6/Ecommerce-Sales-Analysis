Ecommerce Sales Analysis Project Summary

Objective:
This project aims to analyze ecommerce sales data to uncover insights related to customer behavior, product trends, and overall business performance using Python.

Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset.

Converted date columns into datetime format.

Created a new column for total sales (Quantity * Unit Price).

Removed missing values and standardized data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identified top-selling products and best-performing customers.

Analyzed country-wise sales distribution.

Evaluated monthly sales trends to detect seasonality.

RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary):

Calculated customer purchase recency, frequency, and total spending.

Identified valuable and at-risk customers.

Churn Analysis:

Determined inactive customers based on median recency.

Assessed potential churned customers for retention strategies.

Product Trends Over Time:

Analyzed top product sales over different months.

Visualized changing demand patterns.

Seasonality and Profitability Analysis:

Investigated peak and off-peak seasons for sales.

Estimated profitability by assuming cost as 70% of unit price.

Identified the most profitable products.

Visualizations Used:

Line charts for sales trends and seasonality.

Bar charts for top-selling products, customers, and country-wise sales.

Annotated data labels for better interpretability.

Conclusion:
This project provided actionable insights into customer purchasing behavior, high-performing products, and sales trends. The analysis can help businesses improve marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, and enhance customer retention efforts.

Future Enhancements:

Implement predictive modeling for future sales forecasting.

Apply machine learning clustering techniques for customer segmentation.

Optimize pricing strategies based on demand fluctuations.
